## Fault-Injection Countermeasure

I have implemented some fault-injection countermeasure, but It still has issues.

You can find the details of the countermeasure [algorithm 4](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/559.pdf) and source code [here](src/rsa/countermeasure.c).

## Message blinding
I have implemented message-blinding countermeasure.

You can find source code [here](src/rsa/message_blind.c)
